# Sliding Window Problems

This repository contains a collection of LeetCode problems that involve the sliding window technique. The sliding window is a popular algorithmic technique used to efficiently solve problems that involve arrays, strings, or other sequences.

## What is the Sliding Window Technique?

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a "window" (a subarray or substring) as you iterate through the elements of a sequence. The window is adjusted by adding or removing elements from one end as you move the window's starting or ending position. This approach allows you to efficiently process the elements within the window, often in a linear or sublinear time complexity.

The sliding window technique is commonly used to solve problems that involve finding subarrays, substrings, or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions or constraints.

## How to Use This Repository
